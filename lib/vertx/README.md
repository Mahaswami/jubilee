Because embeded Vertx doesn't support modules, I have to copy the ruby api
from the [mod-lang-jruby](https://github.com/vert-x/mod-lang-jruby) project.

Some of the files that are not required for the jubilee api are removed.

These files are exactly the same as the original project, except the directory
name changed to follow the ruby conversion of namespaces.
